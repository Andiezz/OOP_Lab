9. Which classes are aggregates of other classes? Checking all constructors of whole classes if they initialize for their parts?
- The CompactDisc class is aggregate of Track class
- MediaComparatorByCostTitle, MediaComparatorByTitleCost and Media
- Media and Store
- Media and Cart
- Store and Aims
- Cart and Aim

10. If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?
- Error


12. What class should implement the Comparable interface?
- class Media
In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo() method be to reflect the ordering that we want?
- if the string title is bigger than the other, return 1
				 less 		    , return -1
				 equal to		    , return 0
- implement the same with the cost
Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. 
How would you modify your code to allow this?
- override the method compareTo() in the DVD class
